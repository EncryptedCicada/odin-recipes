    <h1>Baked Buttermilk Chicken Tenders</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div>
        These baked chicken tenders have a deliciously crispy panko bread crumb coating for that extra crunch factor
        without the guilt of frying! You can marinate the tenders in light buttermilk in the refrigerator for 1 hour
        instead of dipping in the beaten egg.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>1 Â¼ cups panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with
            cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place egg in a shallow dish. Place panko, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper into a
            large zip-top freezer bag and mix well.</li>
        <li>Dip 2 chicken strips into egg, then place into panko mixture and shake to coat. Place coated chicken pieces
            onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken.</li>
        <li>Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray twice.</li>
        <li>Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Flip and continue to bake on opposite side until no longer
            pink in the centers, about 7 minutes more. Remove from the oven.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 1 to 2 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
